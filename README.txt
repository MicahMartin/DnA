This is a Algorithms and datastructures repository for SIB fall 2013

Feel free to add any problems that you might see on technical interviews to
the Problems folder in their own file.  

Work on these problems in either psuedo code, ruby, or another language. 

If you want help with a problem, place your solution into your folder and issue a
pull request. Ethan or I will try to help.
